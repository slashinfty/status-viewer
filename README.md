# status-viewer

You need four things for this to work:

* An OpenWeatherMap city ID
* An OpenWeatherMap API key
* A Google Calendar API Client ID
* A Google Calendar API key

The OpenWeatherMap city ID can be found in the [city list JSON](https://github.com/slashinfty/status-viewer/raw/master/city.list.json). A free OpenWeatherMap API key can be generated by creating an account on [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/appid). Obtaining and setting up for the Google Calendar API is described on [Google Developer](https://developers.google.com/calendar/quickstart/js) pages.

A JSON file for uploading should be built as follows:
```json
{
  "OWMID": "INSERT OPENWEATHERMAP CITY ID",
  "OWMAPI": "INSERT OPENWEATHERMAP API KEY",
  "GCALID": "INSERT GOOGLE CALENDAR CLIENT ID",
  "GCALAPI": "INSERT GOOGLE CALENDAR API KEY"
}
```

Alternatively, the required information can be included in the URL:
`https://mattbraddock.com/status-viewer?OWMID=CITY_ID&OWMAPI=OWM_API_KEY&GCALID=CALENDAR_CLIENT_ID&GCALAPI=CALENDAR_API_KEY`
