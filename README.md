# status-viewer

You need four-five things for this to work:

* An OpenWeatherMap city ID
* An OpenWeatherMap API key

The OpenWeatherMap city ID can be found in the [city list JSON](https://github.com/slashinfty/status-viewer/raw/master/city.list.json). A free OpenWeatherMap API key can be generated by creating an account on [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/appid).
A JSON file for uploading should be built as follows:

```json
{
  "OWMID": "INSERT OPENWEATHERMAP CITY ID",
  "OWMAPI": "INSERT OPENWEATHERMAP API KEY"
}
```

Alternatively, the required information can be included in the URL:
