# status-viewer

Simple clock, weather, and calendar display, primarily for fullscreen viewability. Current weather updates every 15 minutes, while daily forecast updates every hour.

You need two things for this to work:

* A ZIP code
* An OpenWeatherMap API key

A free OpenWeatherMap API key can be generated by creating an account on [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/appid).

You can bypass the prompts and auto-load values with URL search parameters: `https://mattbraddock.com/status-viewer?zip=YOUR_ZIPCODE&owmapi=YOUR_OWM_API_KEY`
