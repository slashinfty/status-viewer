# status-viewer

You need two things for this to work:

* A ZIP code
* An OpenWeatherMap API key

A free OpenWeatherMap API key can be generated by creating an account on [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/appid).

You can bypass the prompts and auto-load values with URL search parameters: `https://mattbraddock.com/status-viewer?zip=YOUR_ZIPCODE&owmapi=YOUR_OWM_API_KEY`
